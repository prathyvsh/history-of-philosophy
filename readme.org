Opposed the theory of [[/#pietro-pomponazzi][Pietro Pomponazzi]] that the rational soul is inseparably bound up with the material part of the individual and hence that the death of the body carries with it the death of the soul. He insisted that the soul as part of the absolute intellect is industrctible and on death of the body it is merged in the eternal unity.

Pupil: Gian Giacomo Adria

Was primarily a supporter of Averroes' interpretation of Aristotle, but later moved on from it.

* Pietro Pomponazzi
(16 September 1462 – 18 May 1525)
Italian philosopher
Colleague of [[/#alessandro-achillini][Alessandro Achillini]]

Developed his views within the framework of natural philosophy.

Sought to eliminate supernatural explanations in that he targeted the popular belief that miracles are produced by angels and demons. Used interpretations of Aristotle to claim that the highest activity of the intellect, the attainment of universals in cognition is always mediated by sense impression and therefore based on philosophical premises and Aristotelian principles, the conclusion is that the entire soul dies with the body.

This housed violent oppositions and led to a spate of books written against him.

(5 September 1533 – 15 October 1589)
Italian Aristotelian philosopher and Logician

Teacher: Francesco Robortello in humanities
Bernardino Tomitano in Logic
Marcantonia Genua in Physics
Pietro Catena in Mathematics

Produced work on nature of logic and scientific method. His goal was the retrieval of the genuine Aristotelian concepts of science and scientific method. Developed the method of regresses, combination of the deductive procedures of composition and the inductive procedures of resolution.

He aimed to differentiate the sciences from the arts. 

There were two senses of his idea of method: He called ordo/order of presentation which is used as a method of presenting existing knowledge and a narrow sense as a method of discovering knowledge which he reserved for methods in its proper understanding.

He disagreed with Galen's view that there are four kinds of methods of presentation.

Compositio/synthesis (methodus compositiva) is used in the contemplative or theoretical sciences that aim at perfect knowledge. Here the order of presentation follows the way of composition from general principles to particular beings. In moral philosophy and arts which aim at action or production, order follows the way of resolution (methodus resolutiva resolutio/analysis) from the desired end to its first principles.

It is said that if Ramus is the anti-Aristotelian pole, then Zabarella can be considered as the Aristotelian representative.
